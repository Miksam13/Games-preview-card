        <p class="ds_text">America, 1899. The end of the wild west era has begun as lawmen hunt down the last remaining outlaw gangs. Those who will not surrender or succumb are killed.

            After a robbery goes badly wrong in the western town of Blackwater, Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the best bounty hunters in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland of America in order to survive.

            As deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the gang apart, Arthur must make a choice between his own ideals and loyalty to the gang who raised him.

            From the creators of Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a sprawling tale of life in America at the dawn of the modern age.  Seek out the mysterious travelling saleswoman Madam Nazar to acquire the Collector’s Bag and get started on the path of the Collector. With Madam Nazeer’s help, you will be able to explore the world finding valuable treasures, whether they’re discarded Tarot cards in abandoned camps, buried treasures unearthed with your trusty shovel, hidden family heirlooms and more.</p>

        <p class="ds_text">Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… And teach his son to do the same. With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre. From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. Go behind the curtain and watch the Santa Monica Studio development team as they deconstruct the core elements that defined the series — satisfying combat, breathtaking scale, and a powerful narrative — and fuse them anew. His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus behind him, Kratos now lives in the realm of Norse deities and monsters.</p>

        <p class="ds_text">You are Geralt, from the city of Rivia. All around you the towns and settlements of the Northern Kingdoms are being razed to the ground, as an otherworldly invading army known only as the Wild Hunt leaves a trail of blood-soaked destruction in its wake.

            As you prepare for a thunderous confrontation with the Wild Hunt, you’ll uncover a complex, gripping story and meet unforgettable characters. While exploring the Northern Kingdoms, you’ll discover that mysteries lurk inside every village, tree, and shadow. Travel to an island nation of warrior clans, weather-beaten fishing villages, and ferocious giants. The ancient peoples of Skellige respect two things above all else: the sea, and their elders. Prove your worthiness to discover the true wealth of these frozen isles. Navigate a web of wealthy merchants, religious fanatics, and scandalous street-walkers in the grimy port town of Novigrad. A city divided by political rivalry and powerful criminal undercurrents, you’ll find words and wit serve better than any blade, so pick your allegiances carefully. Trawl vibrant villages, boggy marshes, and forgotten caverns in the heart of the Northern Kingdoms. Velen’s battle-scarred hinterlands are home to some of the nation’s darkest secrets and most dangerous beasts. Tread carefully among the endless wilderness, but be sure to leave no stone unturned.</p>
